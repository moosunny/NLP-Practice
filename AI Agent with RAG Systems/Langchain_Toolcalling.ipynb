      "이탈리아 요리는 각 지역마다 고유한 특색이 있고 다양하지만 크게 북부와 남부로 구분한다. 다른 나라와 국경을 맞대던 북부는 산업화하여 호황을 누리면서 농업이 발달한 덕분에 쌀이나 유제품이 사용되는 요리가 많지만 경제적으로 침체됐던 남부는 지역 특산물인 올리브와 토마토, 모짜렐라 치즈나 해산물을 활용한 요리가 많다.\n",

      "이탈리아 요리에 대해 최초의 저술을 남긴 사람은 그리스계 시칠리아 사람인 아케스트라투스이다. 기원전 4세기에 지금의 시라쿠사 지역에 살던 그는 “계절에 맞는 최상의 재료”를 사용하는 것에 대한 시를 남겼다. 그는 또한 향신료나 허브, 양념 따위를 사용한 음식과 그 중요성, 생선 요리 등에 대해 서술했다. 특정 양념이나 향신료가 지나쳐서는 안 된다는 것 또한 집필 내용에 포함됐지만 470가지의 요리법을 담은 책인 《데 레 코퀴나리아》(De re coquinaria《요리에 관하여》)를 출판하면서 이런 형태의 요리는 역사 속으로 사라졌다. 이 책은 생선의 비린내나 특정 재료의 맛을 숨기면서 다른 맛을 낼 수 있는 소스에 대해서 서술해 놓았다. 로마 사람들은 그리스 최고의 제빵사를 고용해서 빵을 만들었고 가장 뛰어난 재료로 알려져 있던 페코리니(pecorini)를 시칠리아에서 수입해 왔다고 한다. 로마인은 염소를 사육해 육식을 함과 동시에 여러 가지 식물도 재배한 것으로 알려져 있다.\n",

      "=== 중세 ===\n",
      "시칠리아 지방으로 로마와 아테네의 요리 문화가 유입됐고 섬 지형에 맞게 변형되고 다시 새로운 요리로 탈바꿈하게 됐다. 이탈리아 요리의 뿌리가 시칠리아에 기원한다고 볼 수 있는 셈이다.\n",
      "\n",
      "무슬림이 9세기까지 시칠리아를 침략하여 다스렸고 그 뒤에는 바이킹 세력이 남하하여 지중해 일대는 상당한 혼란기를 겪었다. 아랍인들은 시금치, 아몬드, 쌀 등을 도입했으며, 이러한 재료의 출현은 12세기 노르웨이의 왕이 시칠리아에 왔을 때 사람들이 기다란 면발을 만들어 먹었다는 것을 보았다고 기록한 것을 토대로 알 수 있다. 이 요리를 일부에서는 파스타의 첫 출현이라고 보고 있다. 당시에는 면을 단순히 밀가루와 물로 만들었다고 하는데, 사람들이 “아트리야”(atriya)라고 불렀다가 나중에는 “트리”(trii)로 굳어졌다고 한다. 트리(Trii)라는 이 낱말은 남부 이탈리아에서 스파게티의 다른 이름으로 쓰이기도 했다. 노르만 족들은 청어나 대구 따위를 절여 먹는 법도 들여왔으며, 이 방법은 아직까지도 이탈리아에서 사용되고 있다.\n",
      "냉장고가 없던 시절에 음식 저장법은 매우 중요했으며, 그 방법은 물리적이면서 화학적이기도 했다. 육류나 생선은 훈제하거나 얼음 위에 보관했고 아니면 건조시켰다. 소금물이나 소금에 식재료를 절여 두는 것은 청어나 돼지고기, 피클 따위를 보관하는 방법으로 유용하게 쓰였으며, 식초나 기름 등을 함께 넣어 동물성 단백질이 변질되지 않도록 했는데, 이는 지금의 방부제와 유사한 효과를 냈다. 과일 보관에는 술이나 꿀, 설탕이 쓰였다.\n",
      "\n",
      "이탈리아 반도 북부 지방에서는 독일 요리의 특징과 고대 로마식 요리의 특징이 서로 겹치는 현상이 나타났으며, 남쪽에는 아랍 문화에 토대한 식사 형태가 뿌리내려 지중해 일대로 널리 퍼져 갔다. 가장 오래된 이탈리아의 요리책은 13세기 나폴리에서 집필됐다고 전해지는 《리베르 데 코퀴나》(Liber de Coquina)로서 한국어로는 말 그대로 《요리책》이다. 이 책에는 로마식 배추 요리나 작은 잎을 잘라서 요리한 음식인 라바냐 파이(Lavagna pie)를 비롯해서 지금도 볼 수 있는 생선 요리도 많이 소개되어 있다.\n",
      "15세기에는 바티칸의 요리사로 근무한 마르티노가 《리브로 데 아르테 코퀴나리아》(Libro de Arte Coquinaria, 《요리법》)라는 원고를 써서 그때까지 소개된 책과는 아주 다른 고품격 음식을 다루었다. 그 중 한 가지는 “마카로니 시칠리아니”(Maccaroni Siciliani, 시실리풍 마카로니)인데 얇은 철제 기구에 밀가루 반죽을 덮어서 햇빛에 말려 먹는 요리였다. 주재료인 마카로니는 갓 잡은 수탉과 함께 요리하였고 사프란을 첨가했다. 그는 이 요리가 아랍 문화의 영향을 받았다고 적어 놓았다. 로마인의 요리법으로 포함된 것 중에는 양배추로 요리한 음식과 “코피에테”(coppiette)가 있었다. 그가 선보인 피렌체 풍 음식으로는 달걀로 요리한 볼로네즈 토르타(Bolognese Torta, 볼로냐풍 케이크)와 시에니즈 토르타(Sienese torta, 시에나풍 케이크)가 있었는데 제노바 풍 마카로니 요리, 호박, 버섯, 시금치를 이용해 만들었던 파이 등도 함께 다뤘다.\n",
      "마르티노의 요리는 1475년 베네치아에서 바르톨로미오 플라티나가 출판한 《참된 즐거움과 건강에 대하여》(De honesta voluptate et valetudine)에도 소개되었다. 마르티노의 원고를 참고해서 지역에 따라 분류하고 정리했으며, 마조레 호수의 농어나 가르다 호수의 정어리 등 인근에서 가져다가 사용한 식재료와 해당 음식을 자세히 설명하였다.\n",

      "이탈리아의 정통 요리는 피렌체와 로마, 베네치아, 페라라의 궁중에서 요리 문화가 꽃피운 이후 본격화하였다. 그중에서도 페라라의 에스테 궁전이 요리 문화의 선두 주자가 됐다. 1549년 이폴리토 데스테의 집사였던 크리스토포로 메시스부고(Christoforo Messisbugo)가 《Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande》를 출판하면서 이탈리아의 파이나 타르트를 소개했다. 그 책에서는 동양이나 동부 지방에서 유입된 재료, 124종의 다양한 양념에 대해서도 설명해 놓았다.\n",
      "\n",
      "1570년 교황 비오 5세의 개인 요리사였던 바르톨미오 스카피가 책 《오페라》(Opera)를 써냈다. 다섯 권으로 구성된 이 책은 요리하는 방법을 천 가지 이상 설명해 놓았을 뿐만 아니라 정찬에서 어떤 형태로 음식이 나가고 식단이 결정됐는지, 조리 기구나 요리하는 모습도 상세히 다뤘다. 다른 궁중에서 전해졌던 책과 이 책이 특별히 다른 점은 가금류를 요리하는 법이다. 인근의 동물이나 새를 잡아서 어떤 식으로 다듬고 깨끗하게 잘라내는지가 나와 있다. 혀나 머리, 어깨뼈 부위를 손질하는 방법도 다뤘다. 제3권에서는 생선이나 사순절에 먹는 음식을 설명했다. 생선 요리는 구워 먹거나 탕류, 찜으로 먹었으므로 상당히 간단했다. 제5권에서는 나폴리풍 피자 요리법이 등장하는데 당시 이탈리아에는 토마토가 존재하지 않았으므로 피자가 지금의 맛이 아니라 달거나 짭짜름한 맛이었다. 옥수수나 칠면조 역시 없었으므로 현대인이 생각하는 음식 문화와는 상당히 달랐다. 이외에 타라트나 파이, 얇게 썬 과일 튀김에 대해서도 썼다.\n",
